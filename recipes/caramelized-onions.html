            <li>2 onion, sliced</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter, ghee or oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Add the butter or oil and sliced onions to a large pan on medium heat. </li>
            <li> Give them a stir to ensure the onions are all fully coated, then sprinkle on the salt and stir again. </li>
            <li> Reduce the heat to medium low (or low if you have a large burner) and stir the onions every 2-3 minutes, allowing them to caramelize on the bottom in between stirring. </li>
            <li> If the onion start to dry out and stick to the pan, add 1-2 tablespoons of water or broth to deglaze the pan (give it a good scrape) and rehydrate the onions. </li>
            <li> Continue this process of stirring, scraping and deglazing until the onions have cooked for 45 minutes or until they're cooked to your liking. </li>
            <li> Use the caramelized onions on a variety of recipes or store in the fridge for several days. </li>
        </ol>
